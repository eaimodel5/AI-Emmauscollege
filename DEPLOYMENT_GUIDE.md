## 🔧 Environment Variables

If your app uses the Gemini API, set these environment variables in your hosting platform:

- **Variable Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Setting Environment Variables:

**Netlify:**
1. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key

**Vercel:**
1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key

**GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to Repository Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions
2. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a repository secret

## 🚀 Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

I've created a GitHub Actions workflow that can deploy to multiple platforms automatically. To use it:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Set up the required secrets in your repository:
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (for Netlify)
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` (for Vercel)
   - `ORG_ID` and `PROJECT_ID` (for Vercel)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/workspace/
├── dist/                    # Production build (ready to deploy)
├── .github/workflows/       # GitHub Actions for auto-deployment
├── netlify.toml            # Netlify configuration
├── vercel.json             # Vercel configuration
├── _redirects              # Netlify redirects for SPA routing
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md     # This guide
```

## 🌐 Your Site URLs

After deployment, you'll get URLs like:
- **Netlify**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Vercel**: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- **GitHub Pages**: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 on refresh**: Make sure SPA redirects are configured
2. **API not working**: Check environment variables are set
3. **Build fails**: Run `npm run build` locally first

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview locally
npm run preview
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred deployment method
2. Follow the specific instructions above
3. Set up your environment variables
4. Share your live URL!
